## Overview

The Campaigns page shows every outbound effort you have running. If you have not created one yet, you will see a friendly prompt with a single button that launches the campaign builder.

## Campaign cards

Each card highlights:

- Campaign name and type (Prompt or Pathway).
- Tags that define the audience, plus the AI and human agents assigned to the outreach.
- A preview of the script or pathway so you can remember what the AI will say.
- Contact counts and creation date for a quick health check.
- Inline delete button when you need to retire a campaign.

Click anywhere else on the card to open the detailed campaign view.

## Building a campaign

1. **Name and audience** – give the campaign a title and select a tag. Telentir shows how many contacts currently share that tag so you know the reach.
2. **Knowledge base (optional)** – link a knowledge base if you want the agent to answer detailed product questions mid-call.
3. **Agents** – pick one AI agent and optionally add human transfer targets. The interface points out when you have not created any human agents yet.
4. **Campaign type** – choose **Prompt** to paste a custom script or **Pathway** to reuse an existing conversational flow. Only live pathways appear in the list so you never pick an unfinished draft.
5. **Review and publish** – save the campaign to push it live. Telentir immediately makes it available to automations and the dashboard.

## Blank-state reminder

Even if everyone on the team is new to Telentir, the first visit to Campaigns explains what the feature does and includes a prominent **Create first campaign** button so you can get moving right away.
