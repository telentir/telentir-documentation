## Filters you can trust

- **Search bar** – finds contacts by name or phone number.
- **Status filter** – toggle Completed, Missed, Voicemail, or Callback Requested to isolate specific outcomes.
- **Date range** – use the From/To pickers to focus on a particular day, week, or month.

All three filters work together, making it easy to answer questions like “How many calls did we miss last Tuesday?”

## Reading the table

Each row includes the date, contact, phone number, duration, direction, and status. Direction and status pills use the same colors as the rest of the dashboard so you can skim for anomalies quickly.

If no calls match your filters, the table displays a clear “No call records found” message.

## Monitoring a call after the fact

Click **Monitor** on any row to open the detailed call drawer:

- Listen to the recording with basic play/pause controls.
- View agent assignments, call direction, stage, and precise timing.
- Read the live transcription log when it is available.

Because the monitor reuses the same drawer as the Live Monitoring page, you get a familiar experience whether you are reviewing a current call or one that finished days ago.
