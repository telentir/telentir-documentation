## Conversation list

The left rail shows one entry per phone conversation. Each item displays the contact name (or phone number), the Telentir number used, the latest preview, and when the last message arrived. Use the list to jump between conversations without losing your place.

## Starting a new thread

1. Click **New conversation**.
2. Pick one of your Telentir phone numbers that supports outbound messaging.
3. Enter the recipient’s phone number.
4. Press **Start conversation** to open the composer with that pairing ready to go.

## Deep links from other tools

When you click **Message** from the Contacts page (or any other shortcut), Telentir pre-fills the conversation using the information that was passed along. You are dropped straight into the right thread or a fresh draft if this is the first time you are texting that person.

## Writing and sending messages

- Type your note in the composer. Press **Enter** to send or **Shift + Enter** for a new line.
- Delivery status (queued, sent, failed) appears directly beneath each outbound bubble.
- Any send errors show up below the composer so you know exactly what to retry.

## Empty state

If no conversation is selected yet, the page reminds you to pick one from the left or start a new thread. This keeps the interface clear for new users who are still getting used to SMS workflows inside Telentir.
