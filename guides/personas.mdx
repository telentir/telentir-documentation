## Browsing personas

Scroll through the list to see each persona’s name, gender, description, and tags. Use the search bar at the top if you already know what you are looking for.

## Copying IDs

Need to assign a persona to an agent or campaign? Click the clipboard icon on any row to copy its ID. Paste it wherever Telentir asks for a persona reference.

## Hearing a persona

1. Type sample text into the input field next to the persona you want to test.
2. Click **Play**. Telentir sends the text to the voice engine and returns an audio preview a moment later.
3. Listen, tweak the script, and play it again until you are happy with the sound.

Previewing personas regularly helps creative teams keep your AI agents on brand, and it reassures stakeholders that every campaign sounds the way it should.
