## What you see first

The dashboard opens with a performance summary that compares your current activity to previous periods. Use the presets (`This month`, `Last month`, `Last 7 days`) or click **All agents** to remove agent-specific filtering.

## Reading the KPI cards

Each card highlights a core signal:

- **Contacts reached** – successful call outcomes where the AI agent spoke with a human.
- **Minutes used** – total talk time, helpful for monitoring plan usage.
- **Avg. call duration** – average conversation length, useful for spotting unusually short or long calls.
- **Success rate** – percentage of call attempts that turned into real conversations.
- **Transfer rate** – how often the AI brings a human on the line.
- **Total calls** – outbound attempts placed during the selected window.
- **Inbound calls** – answered calls that originated from customers.
- **SMS sent** – outbound text messages delivered by the system.

The small delta badge under each metric shows whether you are trending up or down versus the previous comparable period.

## Exploring charts

Select any metric tab to expand it into a line chart. The visualization automatically scales to your data, so spikes or dips are easy to spot. If there has not been any activity yet, the chart displays a friendly "No activity" message instead of leaving the area blank.

## Tips for analysis

- Switch between time filters to confirm whether a spike is new or something that has been building for weeks.
- Use the chart to verify that transfers, inbound calls, and SMS remain in balance with total call volume.
- When metrics appear flat, make sure you have the correct agent or date range selected before raising a support ticket.
