## Creating a key

1. Enter a descriptive name (for example, "Production webhook" or "Zapier test").
2. Click **Create API Key**. Telentir immediately shows the new key in a highlighted panel.
3. Copy the value and store it in a secure password manager. This is the only time the full key is visible.

If you leave the page without copying the key, delete it and create a fresh one—the system cannot display it again for security reasons.

## Managing existing keys

The "Active API keys" section lists every credential you have created, sorted newest first. Each card contains the key name, raw value, copy button, creation date, and last-used timestamp.

## Deleting a key

Click **Delete** on any card and confirm the prompt. Telentir revokes the key immediately so it can no longer access your APIs.

## Error handling

- The page surfaces validation issues (for example, missing name) directly beneath the form.
- If copying fails because of browser restrictions, Telentir lets you know so you can copy the string manually.
