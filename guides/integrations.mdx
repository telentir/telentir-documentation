## Adding an integration

1. Choose the provider from the dropdown. Calendly is available today, and more services can be added later.
2. Fill in the required fields. For Calendly, that means a Personal Access Token and the booking link Telentir should use.
3. Submit the form. A success message confirms the connection, and the integration appears in the list below.

## Viewing connections

Connected integrations show up as cards that include:

- Provider badge and friendly name.
- Last updated timestamp.
- Key metadata such as the scheduling link, event type, and stored token (masked as needed).
- A remove button that disconnects the service after you confirm.

## Troubleshooting tips

- If the form fails to save, read the inline error message—most issues are caused by expired tokens or typos in the booking link.
- Delete and recreate the integration whenever you rotate credentials so Telentir always has access to the latest keys.
