## Inbound configurations

Each configuration bundles everything Telentir needs to answer a call: the primary AI agent, optional human escalation targets, either a scripted prompt or a conversational pathway, and (optionally) a knowledge base. The card list summarizes that setup and gives you quick edit/delete controls.

### Creating or editing a configuration

1. Choose a name and description so your team knows the intent (e.g., "Support line" or "Spanish sales").
2. Select the AI agent who should pick up first.
3. Add human agents who can accept transfers if required.
4. Decide whether the AI should follow a scripted prompt or a published pathway.
5. Link a knowledge base when callers are likely to ask detailed questions.
6. Save the configuration; it becomes available for number assignments immediately.

## Linking phone numbers

Below the configuration list is every Telentir number capable of receiving inbound calls. Use the dropdown next to each number to attach it to one of your inbound configurations. The **Detach** button removes the link if you want to free up the number for something else.

## Best practices

- Keep descriptions updated so the rest of your team can see at a glance which scenario each configuration covers.
- Detach numbers before you delete a configuration to avoid unexpected routing gaps.
- When you purchase new numbers, visit this page to hook them up to a configuration right away.
