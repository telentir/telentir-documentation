## Filtering and search

Use the search box to find tasks by title or contact name. The status dropdown (All, Pending, In Progress, Completed) lets you focus on the work that matters right now.

## Bulk selection

Click the checkbox in the table header to select everything currently visible. The blue banner above the table confirms how many tasks are selected and gives you room to add future batch actions, such as marking items complete.

## Adding or editing a task

1. Click **Add Task** (or **Edit** on any row).
2. Fill in the title, related contact, due date/time, priority, status, and assignee.
3. Save your changes. New tasks appear immediately; edits update in place.

## Row actions

Every row includes:

- Title, related contact, due date, priority badge, status badge, and assignee.
- **Edit** for quick adjustments.
- **Delete** when a task is no longer needed (the system asks for confirmation before it disappears).

If no tasks match your filters, a friendly empty state lets you know everything is wrapped up for now.
