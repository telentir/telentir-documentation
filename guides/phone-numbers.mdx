## Managing your inventory

The table lists every number Telentir manages on your behalf. For each entry you can:

- Edit the friendly name or add a description.
- See supported capabilities (Voice, SMS, MMS), the provider, and monthly price.
- Delete the number if you no longer need it.
- Refresh the list to fetch the latest state from Telentir.

## Buying a new number

1. Click **Buy Number**.
2. Choose the provider (Telentir currently uses Twilio), country, number type (local, mobile, toll-free, etc.), and an optional description.
3. Review the available numbers, including price, required address information, and capabilities.
4. Select a number and press **Buy Number**. If the country requires a verified address, the modal guides you through entering that information first.
5. Once the purchase succeeds, the number appears in your inventory automatically.

## Managing addresses

Some regions require a local address before you can activate a number. Use the address modal to submit the necessary details (street, city, region, postal code, country) and decide whether emergency calling should be enabled. After the address is approved, retry the purchase.

Keeping your inventory organized ensures that campaigns, inbound flows, and messaging threads always have the correct numbers available.
