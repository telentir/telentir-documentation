## Pathway library

Each pathway appears as a card with its name, current status (draft or live), short description, and last updated date. Use the search box to filter by name when the list gets long.

## Creating a pathway

1. Click **Add New Pathway**.
2. Enter a name and optional description.
3. Save the draft. You can open it in the editor later to build nodes, edges, and branching logic.

## Maintaining pathways

- Click a card to open the pathway editor and adjust the flow.
- Use the status badge as a quick reminder of what is safe to assign to agents or campaigns (keep drafts labeled until you finish testing).
- Delete pathways you no longer need using the trash icon on the card.

Even if you start with simple flows, the pathway library gives your team a single home for every call experience you design.
