## Directory at a glance

The table shows each agent’s type, photo, name, language, persona (for AI) or phone number (for human), calls handled today, success rate, and current status (online/offline). Progress bars and color-coded badges make it easy to spot top performers.

## Adding an agent

1. Click **Add Agent**.
2. Choose whether the new agent is AI or Human. This determines which fields are required later.
3. Upload an avatar if you want a custom photo.
4. Enter the first and last name, pick a language, and (for AI agents) select a persona from the persona library. Human agents provide the phone number Telentir should call for transfers.
5. Save the form to add the agent to your roster.

## Keeping data fresh

- Calls today and success rate update automatically, so leave the page open during the day to watch performance trends.
- Delete an agent at any time with the trash icon—the system confirms before removing anything.
- When a human agent logs out or stops taking transfers, toggle their status to offline so AI campaigns know not to route calls to them.
