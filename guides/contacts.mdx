## Searching and filtering

Use the search bar to look up a contact by name, email, phone number, or company. Need to narrow the list even more? Open the **Tags** menu, select one or more tags, and the table instantly shows only contacts that match all of the tags you picked.

## Managing tags

- Click the `+` chip on any row to add an existing tag.
- Choose **See all** when you want to view or remove every tag attached to a contact.
- Build new tags in the tag manager at the top of the page and they will appear everywhere else automatically.

## AI lead intake

The **Get Leads with AI** button opens a guided form. Describe the leads you want (location, job title, industry, company, etc.) and choose how many credits to spend. The page tells you how many included leads remain in your plan, how many paid leads are still available, and whether additional purchases are needed before you submit.

## Taking action on a contact

Select a contact to open the detail drawer on the right:

- **Call** starts a Telentir voice session with the correct pathway and agent assignments.
- **Message** switches to the Messages tab with the phone number pre-filled so you can continue the conversation over SMS.
- **Email** launches your default email client when an address is on file.

## Table basics

- Columns include company, phone, email, tags, status, and quick actions.
- Use the empty-state prompt (“No contacts found”) as confirmation that no records match your current filters.
- Import or export records at any time with the CSV controls next to the **Add Contact** button.
