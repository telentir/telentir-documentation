## Browsing knowledge bases

Cards display the knowledge base name, short description, and the date it was last updated. Use the search bar to find a specific topic quickly.

## Creating a knowledge base

1. Click **Add Knowledge Base**.
2. Provide a name and (optionally) a description that explains what it covers.
3. Save to create the record, then continue managing documents and FAQs inside the dedicated knowledge base view.

## Managing entries

- Select a card to open the full knowledge base.
- Remove an entry by clicking the trash icon on its card (you will be asked to confirm before anything is deleted).
- When you add or delete items, the list refreshes automatically so the latest state is always visible.

Link knowledge bases to campaigns or inbound configurations whenever you want AI agents to answer detailed product questions confidently.
