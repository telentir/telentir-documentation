## Track every live call

The table lists only calls that are currently underway. Columns include the call ID, contact, agent handling it, elapsed time, stage (dialing, ringing, connected, etc.), and a quick **Monitor** button.

## Auto-refresh toggle

Need an always-on view? Keep **Auto-refresh** enabled and the page will check for updates every second. Want to pause the feed while you investigate a specific call? Turn the toggle off and the list will stay frozen until you are ready to resume.

## Monitoring live calls

Click **Monitor** to open the call drawer. You can listen to the live audio stream (or the buffered portion if the call has just started), read the transcription as it is created, and check agent details—all without leaving the page.

## Quick tips

- Use the live count pill next to the header to confirm how many calls are in flight.
- Keep the page open on a wallboard for teams that supervise multiple agents at once.
- When the table shows “No active calls right now,” it simply means every call is complete; no manual refresh is required.
