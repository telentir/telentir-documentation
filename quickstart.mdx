## 1. Activate your workspace

- Accept your Telentir invite or request access at [telentir.com](https://telentir.com).
- Set up single sign-on (optional) so teammates can join without extra passwords.
- Share your company profile details (name, logo, industry) with Telentir support so outbound touchpoints stay on brand.

## 2. Secure phone numbers

- Navigate to **Phone Numbers** and purchase or import the numbers you want Telentir to manage.
- Assign at least one outbound-enabled number for campaigns and one inbound number for transfers/support.
- Add any required regulatory address information before you go live.

## 3. Configure account defaults

- Work with your Telentir success manager to choose the default AI voice, time zone, and compliance rules.
- Connect integrations such as Calendly or your CRM if you plan to trigger downstream workflows.

## 4. Build your first AI agent

- Head to **Agents** and create at least one AI agent with the correct persona, language, and knowledge base.
- (Optional) Add human agents so the AI knows who can accept warm transfers.

## 5. Upload or sync contacts

- Use the **Contacts** page to import a CSV or push contacts in via API.
- Apply tags (e.g., "Hot Lead", "Event Sign-up") so you can target campaigns precisely.

## 6. Launch a campaign

- Open **Campaigns** and choose whether the AI should follow a Prompt or an existing Conversational Pathway.
- Select the tag-based audience, assign your AI/human agents, attach a knowledge base if needed, and publish.

## 7. Monitor and iterate

- Watch the **Dashboard** for high-level KPIs.
- Use **Live Monitoring** to listen in on active calls and offer coaching.
- Review **Call History** and **Messages** for follow-up tasks.
