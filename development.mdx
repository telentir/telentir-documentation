## Access & security

1. **User provisioning** – Decide whether you will invite users manually or connect to your identity provider (Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace).
2. **Permissions** – Map roles to Telentir workspaces (e.g., Admin, Supervisor, Agent) and confirm least-privilege access.
3. **Audit logging** – Enable your preferred SIEM export if your compliance team needs call metadata outside of Telentir.

## Data flows

- **CRMs** – Use Telentir webhooks or APIs to sync call outcomes, tags, and transcripts back to Salesforce, HubSpot, or the CRM of your choice.
- **Calendars** – Connect Calendly (or the meeting scheduler you rely on) so the AI can book appointments when prospects say "yes."
- **Storage** – Review retention settings for call audio, transcripts, and SMS history to ensure they match your company policy.

## Testing plan

1. Populate a sandbox tag (e.g., `Pilot`) with internal numbers.
2. Run through the entire call flow: AI intro, qualification logic, human transfer, SMS follow-up, CRM sync.
3. Document expected outcomes and share recordings with stakeholders for approval.

## Launch & adoption

- **Training** – Give managers a tour of Dashboard, Live Monitoring, Call History, and Messages so they know how to coach AI performance.
- **Playbooks** – Store objection handling tips, FAQs, and compliance snippets in a knowledge base and link it to every relevant agent.
- **Iteration loop** – Schedule weekly reviews to adjust prompts, pathways, or routing rules based on real call data.

Use this checklist alongside the Quickstart guide to keep your rollout predictable and auditable.
